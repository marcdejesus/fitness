## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Database Schema
Use the model relationships as defined in our documentation. Start with the core models:
- User models (UserProfile, UserSettings)
- Workout models (Exercise, Workout, WorkoutSet)
- Nutrition models (Food, MealEntry)

Add more complex models as needed in later phases:
- Social models (SocialFollow, SocialPost)
- Analytics models (StrengthProgress, BodyMetric)
- Wearable integration models (WearableDevice, DailyActivity)

### API Development
1. Use Django REST Framework for building API endpoints
2. Create endpoints following these patterns:
   - Resource-based URLs (e.g., `/api/workouts/`, `/api/exercises/`)
   - Consistent response formats
   - Proper error handling
   - Authentication and permissions
3. Implement versioning from the start (e.g., `/api/v1/...`)

### Frontend Development
1. Use component-based architecture
2. Implement responsive design from the beginning
3. Use state management (Redux/Context API) for complex state
4. Create reusable UI components for consistency

### Mobile Development
1. Share business logic between web and mobile where possible
2. Use offline-first approach for mobile features
3. Implement native device features progressively

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for all critical business logic
2. API integration tests for backend services
3. UI component tests for frontend
4. End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fitness
   
   # Set up backend
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   
   # Set up web frontend
   cd ../apps/web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   
   # Set up mobile app
   cd ../mobile
   npm install
   npx react-native start
   ```

2. **Create the authentication system:**
   - Set up Supabase client
   - Implement authentication flow
   - Create user profile models and API endpoints

3. **Implement the exercise database:**
   - Create models for exercises
   - Populate database with common exercises
   - Implement exercise API endpoints
   - Create exercise browser interface

4. **Build workout tracking:**
   - Implement workout and set models
   - Create workout logging UI
   - Develop workout history view

## Key Considerations

### Scalability
- Design database schema with future growth in mind
- Implement caching strategies early
- Consider sharding for user data as user base grows

### Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Encrypt sensitive user data
- Regularly audit data access patterns
- Conduct security testing

### Maintainability
- Use consistent coding standards
- Document code and APIs
- Create comprehensive test coverage
- Perform regular code reviews

### User Experience
- Focus on simplicity and ease of use
- Optimize performance for critical flows
- Gather user feedback frequently
- Iterate based on usage patterns

## Conclusion

This phased approach allows us to deliver value quickly while building toward a comprehensive fitness platform. By starting with core features and incrementally adding functionality, we can gather user feedback and adapt our roadmap accordingly.

Each phase builds upon the previous ones, ensuring we maintain a solid foundation while continuously delivering new features. This strategy also helps manage development complexity by breaking the project into manageable chunks with clear milestones.
